# What happend to the open source version?

The open source version of screeenly will remain available for the forseeable future \(at least to the end of 2021\).

I'm still figuring out what exactly should happen to the old screeenly and how a possible end of the hosted version on screeenly.com should look like.

I can assure you, that I will give all users of the opens source screeenly version a notice of at least 6 months before shutting anything down.

So if you're interested in learning how everything started, head to [the GitHub repository ](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/screeenly)of the original screeenly application.
