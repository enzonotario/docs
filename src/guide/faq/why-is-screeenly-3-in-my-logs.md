# What is screeenly 3.0 doing in my logs?

If you came to this page, it's probably because you saw the following user agent string in your webserver access logs.

```text
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; screeenly/3.0; +https://3.screeenly.com/ua)
```

The reason you see the user agent in your access logs is, that someone is using screeenly to generate screenshots or extracting the rendered HTML of your website.

Under normal circumstances, this should never hinder or disrupt your site. If it does, please [let us know](mailto:support@screeenly.com) and we will swiftly resolve the issue.
