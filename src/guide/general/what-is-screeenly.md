# What is screeenly?

screeenly is a software as a service product \(SaaS\) which provides an API to interact with a real web browser through code.

Our API currently supports the following features:

* Create a screenshot of a website
* Generate a PDF of a website
* Get the rendered HTML of a website
* Create a screenshot or PDF of HTML code you send to the API
* Get the rendered HTML of the HTML code you send to the API

If this feature description isn't helpful to you, here are some example use cases, where screeenly can be benefitial for you:

* You want to generate thumbnail images from a collection of URLs. For example, if you're running a bookmarking app.
* You want to create an app which automatically converts websites into PDFs. For example cooking recipes or Wikipedia articles.
* You want to build a price monitoring service for a website which uses a Single-Page-Application for it's store. A real browser needs to load the website in order to extract the product price.
* You want to use HTML and CSS to layout an invoice. You can send the HTML and CSS source code to the API and we will return a PDF file to you.
