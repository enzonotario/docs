# Rate Limit

To protect our servers from heavy load, the API is protected by a rate limit. This means that you can only create a distinct number of API requests in a short period of time.

The current rate limit allows you to make up to **30 requests per minute (60 seconds).**

Keep in mind that the **Rate Limit** is different from the **API usage limit**! \
The rate limit is the same for all plans.

## Concurrent Requests  (experimental)

To further protect our servers from heavy load, we may block your account from making to many concurrent requests to our API.

You may make up to **5 concurrent requests** to our API endpoints.
