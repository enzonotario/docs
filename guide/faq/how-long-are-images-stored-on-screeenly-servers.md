# How long are images stored on screeenly servers?

All screenshots and PDFs generated by screeenly expire 60 minutes after they have been created. 

The image and PDFs files will automatically be removed from our servers and are no longer available to be downloaded afterwards.



We recommend downloading a copy of the generated files to your local server.
